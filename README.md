# Advanced-Facial-Recognition
Our Advanced Facial Attendance System is designed to streamline and enhance the process of tracking attendance by employing state-of-the-art Computer Vision and Machine Learning technologies. With different features aimed at evaluating multiple facets of a person's profile, such as emotion, liveness detection, age and gender profiling, this system is able to detect a person's presence in real-time with great efficiency and limit any chances of fraud.

This system is user-friendly, featuring a frontend developed with ReactJS and a robust backend powered by Python and FastAPI. Users simply upload images or videos through our web application, which are processed by the backend to perform real-time analyses for the different features pertaining to an individual's profile. The outcomes of these processes not only confirm attendance in multiple ways but also ensure the security and privacy of the data involved. The inference speed is also fast, ensuring that the application can be used in the real world setting.
